## 🛠️ Traditional Deployment Problems

- App needed manual setup: OS, libraries, versions, configs.
- Different setups → app crashes.

---

## 📦 What Docker Does

- Packages **code + environment** inside a **container**.
- Same behavior everywhere: Laptop, Server, Cloud.

---

## ⚙️ How Docker Works Internally

| Step | Description |
|:----|:------------|
| 1 | Write a **Dockerfile** (Recipe) |
| 2 | Build a **Docker Image** (Prepared Dish) |
| 3 | Run a **Docker Container** (Dish Served) |

---

## 🍛 Real-World Analogy

- **Dockerfile** → Recipe 📋
- **Docker Image** → Prepared Food 🍲
- **Docker Container** → Food Served 🍽️

Example:  
Swiggy = Recipe ➡️ Prepare Dish ➡️ Deliver to You

---

## 📦 Important Concepts

- **Dockerfile** = Instructions
- **Docker Image** = Read-only snapshot
- **Docker Container** = Running live app
- **Docker Engine** = Core software managing everything

---

## 🔥 Key Points

- 1 Image → Many Containers
- Containers are isolated mini-computers.
- Docker ensures consistent deployments.

## 🧠 Quick Lines

> "Dockerfile → Image → Container → Running App"

> "Docker makes sure your app runs the same everywhere."
